# Notation

**Notation** is a terminal-based hierarchal note-taking app. It is also useful
for todo lists; each item can be marked with a status. It's lightweight and
written in ~1500 lines of Rust; A release build takes slightly over a minute to
compile from nothing.

At the moment, configuration and plugins do not exist, but in the future
configuration WILL be added, and plugins MIGHT.
